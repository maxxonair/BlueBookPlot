# BlueBookPlot

BlueBookPlot is a small cross-platform tool to rapidly visualise data using delimited text files as input. The tool can be used to analyse a single data sets, as well as to compare several sets against each other. Beyond that a file watch function monitors changes to the source file and allows the tool to be used to visualize realtime data.
